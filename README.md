<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About:
In a previous prject, I created a bank app. This app allowed me to deposit, withdraw, and create an account. The project was a website that only included a front-end portion. As such, it was not a secure website, thus it being called a "bad bank". In this app, we upgrade this website into a full stack application. With a secure backend portion, theis full stack app is a complete ready to use banking app. This app concludes the final capstone project in MIT's Full Stacking Coding Program.
